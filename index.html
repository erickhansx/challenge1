        The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA; /ˈnæsə/) is an
        independent agency of the U.S. federal government responsible for the
        civilian space program, as well as aeronautics and space research.[note
        1] NASA was established in 1958, succeeding the National Advisory
        Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). The new agency was to have a
        distinctly civilian orientation, encouraging peaceful applications in
        space science.[7][8][9] Since its establishment, most US space
        exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the Apollo Moon
        landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle.
        NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the
        development of the Orion spacecraft, the Space Launch System, Commercial
        Crew vehicles, and the planned Lunar Gateway space station. The agency
        is also responsible for the Launch Services Program, which provides
        oversight of launch operations and countdown management for uncrewed
        NASA launches. NASA's science is focused on better understanding Earth
        through the Earth Observing System;[10] advancing heliophysics through
        the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research
        Program;[11] exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced
        robotic spacecraft such as New Horizons;[12] and researching
        astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the Great
        Observatories and associated programs.[13]
